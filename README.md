C++ program, combatcalculator.cpp, is designed to take user input for a combat ability and calculate the damage dealt based on specific conditions. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it works, along with suggested improvements and potential features.

Functionality Overview
User Input:

The program prompts the user to enter the ability name, base damage, and ability category.
It reads the ability name and category as strings and the damage as a double.
Validation:

It checks if the ability name and category are valid by comparing them to predefined lists of valid abilities and categories.
It also validates that the damage is positive and does not exceed a certain limit (9000).
Damage Calculation:

If all inputs are valid, the program calculates and prints the damage dealt based on specific criteria.
If the inputs are invalid, appropriate error messages are displayed.
